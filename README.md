# ChifTorrent

An implementation of a torrent client in Node.js 

Decided to feed my curiosity of a how bittorrent actually works by building a simple Console-UI torrent client in Node Js.
Happy Coding.

This tool has the following features:
-	Read and parse torrent file
-	Scrape udp trackers
-	Connect to peers

### Installation
You can install the necessary dependecies by following steps bellow:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MuhiaKevin/ChifTorrent.git
$ cd ChifTorrent
$ npm install
```

### Running the program
Run the following command to download a torrent file

Example :
```sh
$ cd src/
$ node main.js file.torrent
```
### TODO
- Add retry method when when request does not receive tracker
- Get peers from all trackers that are working

### Future improvements
These are some of the additional features i plan to reasearch and implement:
- Use magnet links to download files

- Use Distributed Hash tables instead of trackers
- Allow for more than one downloads
- Create a graphical interface
- Support pausing and resuming downloads
- Use WebRTC to create direct connection to peers
